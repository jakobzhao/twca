TWCA calculator tool

In the Pacific Northwest, water conservation is a very important issue. Due to the existing limitations in this critical resource, it is essential that we understand how our decisions will affect those resources. Therefore, the Turfgrass Water Conservation Alliance and the OSU Cartography/Geovisualization Group are working together to develop a platform that will allow users to gain insight into what their impact on water resources. This tool allows the user to select, visualize, and analyze various datasets that relate to soil type and vegetation. By presenting this data, the user will have the ability to determine how their choices in soil and turf type will perform regarding water consumption. The platform will also feature a calculator that uses the selected variables (soil and turf type) to calculate a water budget. The water budget is intended to influence the user's decisions based on their personal needs and water consumption goals. This collaboration is an exciting opportunity to illustrate the power of a web map due to the enhanced capability of a user to interact and manipulate the cartographic elements of the data they wish to view.
